# ANN_IMAGE CLASSIFIER

This is an image classifier **Deep Learning model** created with the help of *Artificial Neural Network*

####It detects images using deep learning and python


I will be using **Artificial Neural Network** in this project,in perticular ANN is trained on *CIFAR10* dataset of KERAS.

This Cifar10 datasets consits of 10 labels, including

   1. Plane
   2. Automobile
   3. Cat
   4. Dog 
   5. Deer
   6. Ship
   7. Truck
   8. Frog
   9. Horse
   10. Bird
